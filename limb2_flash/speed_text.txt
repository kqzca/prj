How to do motor test using limb_flash code:

1. Connect steps motors and rotary switch board
2. Power up, limb_flash code is in stop mode, user can use:
   3.1 SW3 to select test mode
       0 - Not used
       1 - STR Forward
       2 - STR Backward
       3 - STR Hold
       4 - BEN Forward
       5 - BEN Backward
       6 - BEN Hold
       7 - Not used
       8 - Not used
       9 - Not used
   3.2 SW5 to select speed (RPM)
       1 - 25
       2 - 50
       3 - 75
       4 - 100
       5 - 125
       6 - 150
       7 - 175
       8 - 200
       9 - 225
       0 - Not used
   3.3 SW2/SW4 to select rotations to run, SW2 for tens digit, SW4 for ones digit. Examples:
       SW2 - 0, SW4 - 8: 8 rotations
       SW2 - 2, SW4 - 5: 25 rotations
4. Move SW1 from LOW to HIGH gets limb_flash code into start mode.
   Selected mode/speed/rotations will be executed.
   After selected rotations, motor will stop, no holding.
5. Move SW1 from HIGH to LOW will stop the motr immediately, gets limb_flash code into stop mode

Notes:
1. "Hold" mode has no speed/rotation selections.
2. With current board config, Motor driving voltage VM is 6.5V ~ 6.6 V (no load)
   Selected motor (14H030H-0304) can only run at 125 or 150 RPM highest.
   Increase VM (by decrease R21 or increase R18), will increase highest RPM.
